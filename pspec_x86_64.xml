        <Summary xml:lang="en">Brogue is a Roguelike game for Mac OS X, Windows and Linux</Summary>
        <Description xml:lang="en">Brogue is a Roguelike game for Mac OS X, Windows and Linux by Brian Walker. It is a direct descendant of Rogue, unlike other popular modern roguelikes, and it favors simplicity over complexity, while trying to ensure that the interactions between components will be interesting and varied. It can be played on Mac OS X, Windows, or Linux, and it is possible to play entirely with the keyboard or entirely with the mouse or a combination of the two as the player chooses.</Description>
